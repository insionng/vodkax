## Installation

Vodka is developed and tested using Go `1.6.x` and `1.7.x`

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/insionng/vodka
```

> Ideally, you should rely on a [package manager](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#package-management) like glide or govendor to use a specific [version](https://github.com/insionng/vodka/releases) of Vodka.

### [Migrating from v1](/guide/migrating)

Vodka follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) managed through GitHub releases.
Specific version of Vodka can be installed using a [package manager](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#package-management).
